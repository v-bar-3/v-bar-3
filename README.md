- 👋 Hi, I’m @v-bar-3
- 👀 I’m interested in data science, statistics, computer vision, and machine learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently finishing up a Google Data Analytics certification on Coursera where I will be doing a case study on a certain dataset and topic of my choosing. I plan on learning the Python basics next using freecodecamp's MOOC before learning the Data Analysis tools of that language next.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything! I am new to programming and would like to get involved in anything that piques my interest.
- 📫 How to reach me: email me @ barlettavincent@gmail.com.
